# Lab4 notes

## Overview

Design (with views and perspectives) the system
and implement some of the changes considering the
architecture styles and patterns, non-functional
requirements. The system must have at least one
automated integration test

## Main tasks

1. Define an architecture of the system and the change considering architectural
styles and patterns, non-functional requirements.
2. Adequate viewpoints and perspectives should be selected, explanations of the
decisions and the architecture should be described according to them.
3. Implement at least some of the planed changes (agreed with the lecturer).
4. Implement an automated integration or system test, integrate it with the CI/CD
processes.

**The expected output**: An architecture document, implementation, automated test.

## Suggested document structure

1. Context. Context of the system and the planned change, etc.
2. Views. Content of this section depends on the selection of the views and
perspectives.
3. Testability. The test-case, its scenario and the related
attributes described for the automated test should be provided apart from
the other information.
4. Traceability. Mapping with requirements as well as between the views.

*The viewpoints should cover at least the UML 4+1 structure, security
perspective is mandatory as well.*
